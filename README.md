# WCAGCompChecker
This is our HCI project to check websites for WCAG compliance

To run this project make sure python 3.7 is installed on your system.
I highly reccomend using a virtual env for python when working with this project.
All of the python dep are located in req.txt and can be installed in your python env using pip
